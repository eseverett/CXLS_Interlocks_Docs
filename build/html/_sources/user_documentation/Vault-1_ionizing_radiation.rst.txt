Vault-1 Ionzing Radiation Interlock System User Manual
======================================================

Vault-1 Control Protocase
-------------------------

The Vault-1 Control IONIZING RADIATION INTERLOCK protocase shows multiple different hazards in Vault-1.

The SERCURE PERIMETER section of the protocase shows the shows the status of Vault-1 being searched and secured. 
If all the lamps are green, then Vault-1 is in a secure state. When Vault-1 is secure the vault cannot be entered until the accelerator is put into a safe state. 
If the shield door is opened with the accelerator and/or transmitters armed, then the interlock system will trip and put them into a safe state. 

The AREA MONITORS section of the protocase shows the status of RADIATION, OXYGEN, and MICROWAVE. 
These lamps will turn red if any of the radiation, oxygen, or microwave meters in the CXLS suite alarms. 
If any of these meter's alarm and the lamps turn red, then the interlock system will trip, and the accelerator will be put into a safe state. 

The ACCELERATOR section of the protocase shows if the accelerator is armed. If the lamp is green, then the accelerator is armed. The accelerator being armed does not have any meaning besides enabling the transmitters to be armed. The accelerator can only be armed when Vault-1 is secured. Once the accelerator is armed, under the TRANSMITTERS section of the protocase, if the lamps are green then that specific transmitter is armed.

VIEWMARQ displays
-----------------

There are two VIEWMARQ displays that share information on Vault-1 ionizing radiation hazard status. There is one in the Accelerator Lab and one in Vault-1 Control.
